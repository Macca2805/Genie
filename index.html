## About

Our design guidelines are both a learning tool and a compass to correct our course as we build new things. We share our work here to help others on a similar path. By documenting and assembling a reference site of our patterns, we were able to speed up our process and solve some internal communication problems.

## Benefits

Genie is a a common lexicon of code and UI elements benefits us in a few ways:

- We can build consistently, focusing our energy on workflows and logic, not web forms and list items.
- We can reuse code instead of reinventing the wheel or roping in an engineer.
- We can see all of our patterns in one place, quickly revealing maintenance issues.

## App Gallery
It can be a good idea to include a <a href="{{ "/gallery" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">list of applications</a> that use the design system. This helps provide credibility to the system, incentivizes teams to use the system, and shows components in the wild.

## Contributing info
If it's desirable to have people from across the organization contribute to the design system, linking to the <a href="{{ "/contributing" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">contributing page</a> from the homepage could be a good idea.
